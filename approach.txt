1. react
I used React to build the user interface. It helps break the UI into 
small components, which makes the code easier to manage and reuse.

2. react-router-dom
This library helps with page navigation inside the React app, 
without needing to reload the page. It makes routing between 
different parts of the app simple and smooth.

3. antd (Ant Design)
Ant Design provides ready-made UI components like buttons, forms, tables, 
etc. It saves time and gives the app a clean and modern look.

4. @ant-design/icons
This is the icon set that works well with Ant Design. 
It allows me to easily add icons that match the overall design of the app.

5. tailwindcss
Tailwind CSS helps me style the UI using utility classes directly in the HTML.
It gives more control over layout and spacing, and works well with Ant Design 
when I want custom styling.
